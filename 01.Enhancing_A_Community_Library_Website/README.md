# Enhancing A Community Library Website

In this project we are trying to simulate a community work environment, where a number of developers are working on  a single project.

The Objectives are:

1.  To practice cloning a repositiory and working with branches on github

2.  Get experience in staging, commiting and pusing changes from both developers.

3. Create Pull Requests and merge them after resolving possible conflicts.

## Steps:

First thing I did was to create a remote repo on github and clone the repo to my local machine using the `git clone` + my repo link.

![git clone](./img/img%201.png)

Then I created four html files and added randon content into them.

Next, I staged, commited and pushed the update to my remote repo using `git add .` to stage, then `git commit -m <commit message>` to commit changes, then `git push` to push committed messages to remote repo.

Next step was to create a new branch with command `git branch <branch_name>` to create a new branch, then `git checkout <branch_name>` to switch to the branch you created.

I moved on to creating a file and adding random content in it, using `echo "#Book Reviews" > book_reviews.html`

Then I staged, committed and pushed to remote repo.

Next, I raised a pull request and merged to the main branch.

I repeated the same process by creating another branch (update-events) and added random content to the event.html file, then I staged, committed, and pushed to the remote repo.

Thank you
